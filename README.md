## Project Overview: Simple Calculator

### Purpose
The Simple Calculator project aims to create a basic tool that performs fundamental arithmetic operations. This project is ideal for beginners to practice programming concepts and understand how to handle user inputs and outputs.

### Core Features
-**Mathematical Operations**: The calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

-**Input Validation:** Ensures that the user inputs valid numbers and handles errors gracefully.

-**Interactive User Interface:** A simple text-based interface that allows users to select operations and enter values.

-**Continuous Operation:** Users can perform multiple operations in succession without restarting the calculator.

-**Error Handling:** Provides informative error messages for invalid operations, such as division by zero.

### Scope and Limitations
**Environment**: The calculator operates in a command-line interface (CLI).

**Operations**: Only basic arithmetic operations are supported.

**User Input**: Assumes user inputs are valid numerical values or recognized commands (e.g., clear, exit).


### Implementation Steps
**Define Functions**: Create functions for each arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

**User Input Handling**: Implement a loop to continuously take user inputs and perform the selected operation.

**Error Handling**: Use try-except blocks to manage invalid inputs and operations.

**User Interface**: Design a simple text-based menu for users to select operations and enter numbers.
